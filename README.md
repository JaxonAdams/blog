This blog is a full stack website, using Sequelize, MySQL, Express, and Handlebars.js. Sensitive info, namely passwords, are encrypted using bcrypt hashing. Feel free to look around, comment, or even add posts of your own.
    

## Installation
If you wish to download the code, keep in mind the Sequelize setup credentials are protected using dotenv. Make sure to set up a .env file with your MySQL login info to properly run the code on your machine.
